# A clone of the game Flappy Bird in Pygame. 

A simple recreation of the popular at the time game Flappy Bird, entirely in Python and Pygame, no external libraries.

Use the exe if you do not have Pygame installed. I believe it circumvents having to install it.

Your highscores are found in highscores.txt, a file created upon your first highscore. It is in the directory where you downloaded the game.
