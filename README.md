# A clone of the game Flappy Bird in Pygame. 

A simple recreation of the popular at the time game Flappy Bird, entirely in Python and Pygame, no external libraries.

I planned to put an exe in the repo, but unfortunately it was too big. I will instead release the exe in the Releases section, as a zip.
The exe is good for folks who do not have Pygame installed, I believe you do not have to have it installed in order to play.

Your highscores are found in highscores.txt, a file created upon your first highscore. It is in the directory where you downloaded the game.
